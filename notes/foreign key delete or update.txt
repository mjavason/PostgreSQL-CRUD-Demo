When you delete a user in Sequelize, you can specify what happens to the associated profile using the onDelete and onUpdate options in the @ForeignKey definition. These options define the behavior of the foreign key constraint when the related row (e.g., user or profile) is deleted or updated.

Options for onDelete and onUpdate
CASCADE: Automatically deletes or updates the associated row when the primary row is deleted or updated.
SET NULL: Sets the foreign key to NULL if the associated row is deleted.
RESTRICT: Prevents deletion or updating of the primary row if there are associated rows.
NO ACTION: Similar to RESTRICT, prevents action, but with deferred checks (often database-specific).
SET DEFAULT: Sets the foreign key to a default value if the associated row is deleted or updated.
